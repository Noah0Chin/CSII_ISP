Aim Trainer 

Our new idea is to implement create an aim trainer with different mini-games.

Core features:
We will have a main menu screen with interactable buttons for changing settings and gamemode.
Different difficulty levels. 
Example Button: timer for how long to "aim train."
At the end of the session/game the program will give you statistics about your performance.
This will include your stats compared to the average and where you can improve.
Different mini-games within the Aim Trainer (for example a reaction time test). 

Other notes:
Check collision with the bounding rect of different circles on the screen with a bounding rect drawn around the mouse.
On mouse click, compare the two bounding rects and if they overlap then the circle disappears.
This will increase your score or give you credit for hitting the target.
Statistics will be given based on whether you hit certain thresholds. 

Will need to research how to implement various visuals and sounds.
Additionally figure out how multiple people can collaborate to work on different parts of the project at once.
